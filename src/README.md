# Rustdice

Rustdice is a simple and flexible dice implementation to simulate tabletop dice.  The intention is to replicate the functionality provided by [Rubydice, https://github.com/atavistock/rubydice] and then create a ruby/rust bridge.  This is to show a proof of concept rather than a specific need for performmance.
