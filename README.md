# Rustdice

Rustdice is a simple and flexible dice implementation to simulate tabletop dice.  The intention is to replicate the functionality provided by [Rubydice](https://github.com/atavistock/rubydice) and then create a ruby/rust bridge.  

## Why 
The ruby implementation of this doesn't need any perfomance improvments.  This project is more of a proof of concept and to measure the impact of bridging between ruby and rust.
